There are a couple of logical algorithms and data sctrutures developed in C, for learn more about the language and improve logical reasoning like a programmer. Developed in Programming Fundamentals module on beggining of university.

### Why C? ðŸ¤”
In view of this language is the basis of some of the most used languages in current, and I needed to study that for university, it's like joining the useful to the pleasant.
